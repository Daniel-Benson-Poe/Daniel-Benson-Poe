### Welcome to the profile of a Neuroscience enthusiast turned Data Scientist! ðŸ‘‹:books:

My name is Daniel Benson. :name_badge: I am a passionate lifelong student of everything and anything who puts extra care into the initial cleaning and exploratory stages of my projects; I feel these are the most important stages of any Data Science project because clean and accurate data make or break a model or story's success. I am particularly interested in research with AI, Machine Learning, and Neurotechnology.
